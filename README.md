Grid Generator Supplement for APT Assignment 1: Pathfinding Algorithm.

Written in Python using pygame, for a C++ project. nice.

Opens a 20x20 grid, where the user's first click indicates the starting position (Blue), the second left-click indicating the ending position (YELLOW).
Extra left clicks/drag left-clicking creates barriers (Black). 

tldr:
* First left click = starting position
* Second left click = ending position
* Further left clicks = barriers
* Right click = reset grid piece to empty
* Spacebar = saves the output to a file
* C = clears the grid so you can restart
